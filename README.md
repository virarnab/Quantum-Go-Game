# Quantum-Go-Game
Novel version of Go Game to introduce to Quantum Computing Concepts

We introduce Go game and provide a new version of Quantum Go in which the boxes are initially in superposition of 0 and 1 and players have two moves (classical and quantum) to mark each box. The mark on each box depends on the state to which the qubit collapses after measurement. All other rules remain same, except for here, we capture only one stone, and not chains. Due to the enormous power and insane speed of quantum computers, compared to the classical computers, we may think of quantum computing as the future. So, here we have tried to provide a tangible introduction to superposition, collapse and entanglement via our version of Quantum Go.
